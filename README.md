## Overview of the statistical analysis
For this analysis, temperature data for the months of June and December was investigated to find temperature trends in the area of Oahu, Hawaii. 
The purpose of this Surf's Up analysis was to determine different weather statistics for summer and winter months in Hawaii, the intended location of a potential surf and icecream shop. Based on this weather analysis we can determine ideal months for surfing and icecream consumption and inform business strategies.
All this analysis is important to make a great impression to our potential investor.



## Analysis Results
* The June temperature analysis indicates the average monthly temperature is 74.9 (F), the monthly max temperature is 85.0 (F) and the monthly min temperature is 64.0 (F).

* The December temperature analysis indicates the average monthly temperature is 71.0 (F), the monthly max temperature is 83.0 (F) and the monthly min temperature is 56.0 (F).

* The standard deviation in the June temperatures is slightly smaller (3.26) compared to the standard deviation in the December temperature (3.75), this impacts temperature ranges and temperature fluxuation. The range of temperatures in June are smaller and therefore warmer compared to the range of temperatures in Decemeber, which are larger and therefore colder.

What also could be analyzed for both of these months:

* At a first glance, the minimum temperatures for both months was predictably lower during that time of year, December being the lowest.
* The maximum temperature for both had an even less gap with only a two degree difference, December still being the lowest degrees.
* The average temperatures for both months was actually very close. June had an average of 74 degrees and December had an average of 71 degrees.



## Summary
* Comparing the two different months with these descriptive statistics suggestes the average temperatures are fairly similar between the summer (June) month and winter (December) month. However the ranges of temperatures in June are quite warmer compared to the ranges of temperature in Decemeber, which are colder.
* An additional query I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December would be level of precipitation for the different months, to compare rain in summer and winter seasons. Precipitation levels would impact surfing and icecream uptake and business operations.
* Another query I would perform would be, indicators of extreme weather events, it would be interesting to note if hurricanes, cyclones, tsunamis and other extreme weather events were more likley to occur in summer or winter months. This will be helpful for natural distaster safety planning.

As the coding and images analysis shows above, an ice cream business could still have a chance of making a a decent profit margin during these two months. Since the average temperature for both is so close, there is not much unpredicatable weather deviation. The weather is definitely cooler during these months, however, it would not go to a freezing point, so customers could still be expected to make ice cream purchases. There may be some profit less on the surf side of the shop since not many people would be surfing during the coldest month of the year. A survey could be given out to that area to see how many people still enjoy eating ice cream during cooler months.

The code could be refactored again to show the months after December to see how fast the weather stays at a 70 degree average temp.
